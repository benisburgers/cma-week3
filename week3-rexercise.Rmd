This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Tasks and Inputs

## Task 1: Segmentation

### Install libraries

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Import Data

```{r}
caro <- read_delim('caro60.csv')
caro
```

### Custom-Segment the Data

```{r}
caro <- caro %>%
  mutate(
    nMinus3 = sqrt((lag(E,3)-E)^2+(lag(N,3)-N)^2),   # distance to pos -3 minutes
    nMinus2 = sqrt((lag(E,2)-E)^2+(lag(N,2)-N)^2),   # distance to pos -2 minutes
    nMinus1 = sqrt((lag(E,1)-E)^2+(lag(N,1)-N)^2),   # distance to pos -1 minutes
    nPlus1  = sqrt((E-lead(E,1))^2+(N-lead(N,1))^2), # distance to pos +1 mintues
    nPlus2  = sqrt((E-lead(E,2))^2+(N-lead(N,2))^2), # distance to pos +2 minutes
    nPlus3  = sqrt((E-lead(E,3))^2+(N-lead(N,3))^2)  # distance to pos +3 minutes
  )
caro
```

## Task 2: Specify and apply threshold *d*

### Exploring the distances between positions

```{r, warning=FALSE}
caro %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = nMinus3))

caro %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = nMinus2))
```

### Calculating the mean distance for every row

```{r}
caro <- caro %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    stepMean = mean(c(nMinus3, nMinus2, nMinus1, nPlus1, nPlus2, nPlus3))
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

caro
```

### Exploring the mean distances between positions

```{r}
caro %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = stepMean))

caro %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = stepMean)) +
  xlim(0, 10)
```
### Removing 'static' points

```{r}
# Static = Check whether the row step mean is lower than the overall steapMean average
caro <- caro %>%
    mutate(static = stepMean < mean(stepMean, na.rm = TRUE))
caro

# Moving = Only the points where the row average is larger than the overall average
caro_moving <- caro %>%
  filter(static == FALSE)
caro_moving
```
## Task 3: Visualize segmented trajectories

```{r}
caro %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = E, y = N)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = static)) +
  coord_equal()
```
